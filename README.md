# Javascript Exercises/Workouts

### This is my javascript workout. As I am sharpening my javascript skills which has been dull and untapped in the last 2 years.. Just like in any skills in life.. for example sports, one need to hone it constantly.. prolong absence dulls those skills.. and I am not shying away from saying that I am not where I should be or used to be.

Javascript is my first love.. but due to circumstances, I couldn't and didnt have the opportunity to really and fully work on it in my previous jobs..

Now that I am one of the casualty of this covid19.. i get the time to sharpen my javascript skills again..
